          Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This
          gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you
          believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
          with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
          proud of that shit.

          My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit
          about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm
          gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that
          bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
          tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
          You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is
          in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
          all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
          arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
          most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
          back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me
          Mr Glass.

          Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
          called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows,
          and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to
          make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television
          programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones
          that became nothing.
